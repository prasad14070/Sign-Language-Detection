"Sign Language Detection Application. Transforming communication through AI innovation, our project aims to bridge the gap between sign language users and the wider community. We strive to enhance gesture recognition accuracy, provide real-time translation, and foster inclusivity. Overcoming communication barriers, we drive user-centric innovation through robust machine learning models, scalable design, and iterative development."

## Problem Statement:
"Our project addresses the communication challenges faced by the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by leveraging advanced machine learning technology. We aim to enhance inclusivity by providing real-time translation of sign language gestures, overcoming communication barriers, and driving user-centric innovation through robust, scalable, and accessible solutions."

## Proposed Solution:
"The proposed solution involves implementing advanced machine learning models to accurately detect and translate sign language gestures in real-time. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we aim to provide precise and reliable sign language recognition. This will enable seamless communication between sign language users and non-sign language users. Additionally, we plan to enhance accessibility and inclusivity by integrating this technology into various communication platforms, driving user empowerment through innovative and scalable AI solutions."

## How does it work?
1. **Data Collection**: Gather video data of sign language gestures from various sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Extract relevant frames from videos, Perform resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
3. **Model Training**: Use deep learning models (CNNs and RNNs) to train on the preprocessed data, Fine-tune the model for accurate gesture classification.
4. **Real-Time Inference**: Capture real-time video input using a camera, Process each frame with the trained model to detect and classify gestures,Translate detected gestures into text or speech output.
5. **Integration**:Embed the system into communication platforms like mobile and web applications, Ensure seamless operation for end-users, enhancing accessibility and inclusivity.
6. **Continuous Improvement**:Collect user feedback and additional data, Refine and retrain models to improve accuracy and performance.
